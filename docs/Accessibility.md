## Accessibility 
In order to strive for proper accessibility, we focused on giving our HTML-tags proper aria-types. The aria types we used were:
- aria-label
- aria-labelledby
- aria-description
- aria-describedby
- aria-hidden

The types were put according to mozillas aria-guide (generalized for different browsers), which can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes)

Furthermore, we made sure that the application is fully keyboard-supported with tab and enter. 

In addition to this, we have tried to follow the WCAG-standard, which can be found on [this website](https://www.uutilsynet.no/wcag-standarden/wcag-standarden/86)
We have mainly ignored the points about sound and video, since our application doesn't feature this. 

We also made sure that we had a good score from Google lighthouse
