## Decisions

In this section follows descriptions of the choices we have made while developing "WorldExplore", for different aspects of the project.


### Testing

The project contains tests for testing some basic user interaction, checking correct state, snapshot tests, as well as checking for correct rendering. The tests are written using Vitest, as well as the React testing library and jest-dom.

### Usage of Dev

We decided to implement a "Dev" stage to ensure a stable production environment. This helps prevent pushing incomplete products to the main branch. By only merging into main when the entire product is finished, we maintain a cleaner codebase and reduce the risk of introducing bugs or unfinished features into the live version.

### CSS modules

For this project we chose to use CSS Modules instead of regular CSS because they make it easier to manage each component's styles and keep the code more organized.

### Design

We chose a simple and straightforward design with focus on functionality. Our goal was to create an app that's intuitive and easy to navigate. Despite its simplicity, the design remains aesthetically appealing and visually engaging.

### Accessibility

## Usage of AI

We used AI to transform our divs into more suitable elements. We also used it for improving our tests.
